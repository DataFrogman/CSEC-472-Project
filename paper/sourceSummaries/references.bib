	abstract = {In recent years, IoT has developed into many areas of life including smart homes, smart cities, agriculture, offices, and workplaces. Everyday physical items such as lights, locks and industrial machineries can now be part of the IoT ecosystem. IoT has redefined the management of critical and non-critical systems with the aim of making our lives more safe, efficient and comfortable. As a result, IoT technology is having a huge positive impact on our lives. However, in addition to these positives, IoT systems have also attracted negative attention from malicious users who aim to infiltrate weaknesses within IoT systems for their own gain, referred to as cyber security attacks. By creating an introduction to IoT, this paper seeks to highlight IoT cyber security vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques to the reader. The paper is suitable for developers, practitioners, and academics, particularly from fields such as computer networking, information or communication technology or electronics. The paper begins by introducing IoT as the culmination of two hundred years of evolution within communication technologies. Around 2014, IoT reached consumers, early products were mostly small closed IoT networks, followed by large networks such as smart cities, and continuing to evolve into Next Generation Internet; internet systems which incorporate human values. Following this evolutionary introduction, IoT architectures are compared and some of the technologies that are part of each architectural layer are introduced. Security threats within each architectural layer and some mitigation strategies are discussed, finally, the paper concludes with some future developments."}

	abstract={Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has gained significant momentum. However, the original design of BLE focused on star topology networking, which limits network coverage range and precludes end-to-end path diversity. In contrast, other competing technologies overcome such constraints by supporting the mesh network topology. For these reasons, academia, industry, and standards development organizations have been designing solutions to enable BLE mesh networks. Nevertheless, the literature lacks a consolidated view on this emerging area. This paper comprehensively surveys state of the art BLE mesh networking. We first provide a taxonomy of BLE mesh network solutions. We then review the solutions, describing the variety of approaches that leverage existing BLE functionality to enable BLE mesh networks. We identify crucial aspects of BLE mesh network solutions and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we highlight currently open issues.},

        abstract={A fast magnetization reversal in a twisted FeCoV wire induces a pulse voltage in a pick-up coil wound around a wire. The Wiegand sensor is composed of this magnetic wire and the pick-up coil. As the output pulse voltage does not depend on a changing ratio of the applied magnetic field to switch the magnetization of the wire, the Wiegand sensor is used for to perform rotation and other detections. Recently, the Wiegand sensor has attracted significant attention as a power supply for battery-less operation of electric devices and for energy harvesting. In this study, we propose a concept of obtaining an intrinsic pulse voltage from the Wiegand sensor as its power source, and demonstrate its effectiveness in circuit simulation. The equivalent circuit for the Wiegand sensor is expressed by the intrinsic pulse voltage, internal resistance, and inductance of the pick-up coil. This voltage as a power source and circuit parameters are determined by MATLAB/Simulink simulation. The output voltage calculated using the equivalent circuit of the Wiegand sensor agrees with the experimentally measured results.},
